# Digit-Recognizer-based-on-MNIST-data
Kaggle challenge for identifying hand written digits from images taken from the MNIST data set

Trained both a Random Forest classifier and TensorFlow Neural Network for classification. Used the F1 score as an evaluation metric.
Also, reduced the dimensionality of the data set using Principal Component Analysis.
